# Chess Application 
### Author: _William Moss_
#### Version: _1.0_
#### Last Updated: _January 4, 2022_

In this project, I create a chess application from scratch that runs in the console. 

## Description

When the Main class is run, the application creates a new board and makes the move inputted by the user. 

The input must follow the rules of general chess notation (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) for more information). 

Some examples of valid chess moves are e4, Nc3, Bxf7, Rad8, and Nbxd7.

The pieces are visualized with their color initial ('W' for white, 'B' for black) followed by their symbol ('p' for pawns). For example, "Wp" for white pawns.  

## Functionalities Implemented

* Exporting
## Functionalities To Be Implemented in the Future

* Web Application

## Further Notes

This is a project I wanted to do for a while. I started this project on December 29th, 2021 and had to balance it with my career. Nevertheless, I have added a lot of functionalities to the project in a short amount of time and hope to continue the pace in the future.

If you wish to use this project in any published way (especially for monetized reasons), you _**must**_ reach out to me first and credit me in your work. I am generally lenient with people using my projects, however I am against people simply copying code for them to use as their own. Nothing in this project is revolutionary, but give credit when due.

I try to include adequate comments and JavaDocs for everything I do and publish. If there is anything you wish to comment on or critique anything in this project, feel free to comment and/or reach out to me.
